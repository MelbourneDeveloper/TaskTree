/**
 * TREEVIEW E2E TESTS
 *
 * True E2E tests require DOM access which VS Code extension tests don't have.
 * All tree view verification tests have been moved to treeview.unit.test.ts
 * since they access provider internals.
 *
 * This file is intentionally empty - tree view behavior must be tested
 * through unit tests that call provider methods directly.
 */

// No E2E tests for tree view - see treeview.unit.test.ts for unit tests
